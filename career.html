      <h1>My Career</h1>

      <h2>Current Job</h2>
        <p>I currently work at the Triple Crown Plaza Publix as a Customer Service Staff.</p>
        <img src="assets/publix.webp" alt="A Publix store" style="max-width: 50%;">
        <p>My main responsibilities include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Running the help desk, and helping customers with any issues they may have.</li>
            <li>Keep track of each till up at the desk, as well as the registers at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>Make sure everyone is on task and gets their breaks on time.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the skills I've gained through working in customer service include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Working under pressure</li>
        <li>Problem-solving </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Future</h2>
      <p>
        While I love my job and the opportunities I've been given, I don't see myself staying in customer service forever. I would love to eventually use my degree to get into a career I'm more passionate about.
