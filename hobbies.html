      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p>
        I try to do as much as I can with my freetime outside of school and work, here's some of my favorite things to do:
      </p>

      <h2>Baking</h2>
      <p>
        I love to bake for the people I care about! My favorite thing to make would be blueberry muffins since they're my family's favorite. I also really enjoy baking cookies because I like having the freedom to use whatever toppings I want.
      </p>

      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>
        I've always been interested in coding from a young age, but haven't gotten started until a few years ago. My favorite languages to code in would have to be HTML/CSS/Javascript.
      </p>

      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        I like a wide variety of games and it's my favorite way to relax after work with friends. 
      </p>

      <h2>Reading + watching shows/movies</h2>
      <p>
        I also really enjoy reading or watching my favorite things as another way to relax.
